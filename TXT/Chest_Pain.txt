Tags: cardiac, thoracic, pain, adult, angina, chest discomfort, ischemia, acute coronary syndrome, pleuritic pain

Description:
Triage flow for adult patients presenting with chest pain. Includes everyday phrasing so the assistant can match patient language with clinical discriminators. Guides assessment from life-threatening cardiac emergencies to non-urgent mild discomfort.

Glossary Terms Used:

- Airway obstruction (also “I can’t breathe,” “choking feeling”)
- Inadequate breathing (also “tiny breaths,” “gasping”)
- Shock (also “cold, clammy, dizzy,” “feeling faint”)
- Chest pain (also “tightness,” “pressure,” “burning chest”)
- Acute dyspnea (also “sudden shortness of breath,” “can’t catch my breath”)
- Intense pain (≥ 8/10; “worst pain ever,” “unbearable”)
- Moderate pain (4–7/10; “hurts a lot but manageable”)
- Pleuritic pain (also “stabbing pain when I breathe,” “hurts more if I cough”)
- Vomiting (also “throwing up,” “puking”), Vomiting persistent (≥ 3 episodes/h)
- History of cardiac disease (also “I’ve had a heart attack,” “known arrhythmia”)
- Abnormal pulse (also “heart racing,” “skipping beats”)
- Sudden alteration of consciousness (also “I zoned out,” “I just blacked out”)
- Recent event (≤ 14 days; “I had surgery last week,” “fell two days ago”)

Specific Discriminators:
Red:

- Airway obstruction (“I can’t breathe at all”)
- Inadequate breathing (“I’m barely breathing”)
- Shock (“I feel cold, clammy, and like I’ll pass out”)

Orange:

- Chest pain (“It feels like an elephant on my chest”)
- Acute dyspnea (“Suddenly I can’t catch my breath”)
- Intense pain (“It’s an 8 out of 10, I can’t stand it”)
- History of overdose or poisoning (if pain follows ingestion)
- Abnormal pulse (“My heart is racing at 120 bpm,” “It skips a beat”)
- Sudden alteration of consciousness (“I blacked out for a moment”)

Yellow:

- Pleuritic pain (“It stabs me when I breathe in”)
- Vomiting persistent (“I’ve thrown up five times this hour”)
- History of cardiac disease (“I’ve had stents placed before”)
- Moderate pain (“It’s about a 5 out of 10”)

Green:

- Vomiting non-persistent (“I vomited once but feel fine now”)
- Mild recent pain (“A 2 out of 10 pain that started today”)
- Recent event (≤ 14 days; “I had bronchoscopy last week”)

Measurement Notes (patient-friendly):

- “On a scale from zero (no pain) to ten (worst pain), where are you?”
- “How many times do you breathe per minute at rest?” (normal 12–20)
- “Do you feel dizzy or faint when you sit up?” (check blood pressure < 90 mmHg)

Examples of Patient Questions:

- “On a scale of 0 to 10, how bad is your pain right now?”
- “Does the pain get worse when you breathe in or cough?”
- “Have you felt sweaty, nauseated, or lightheaded with this pain?”

Age & Comorbidity Adjustments:

- Elderly may under-report pain intensity.
- Diabetics can present with “silent” (atypical) chest pain.

Immediate Interventions:

- Obtain ECG within 10 minutes.
- Administer aspirin 300 mg if no contraindication.
- Prepare IV access and consider nitrates if not hypotensive.

Associated Sign Checklist:

- Diaphoresis, nausea, lipothymia
- Cool, clammy skin
- Irregular or slow/fast pulse

Quick Protocol Links:

- “Follow ACS pathway if ECG shows ST-elevation.”
- “If PE suspected, order D-dimer then CTPA per protocol.”

Brief Case Examples:
Case A: 55-year-old with crushing pain radiating to jaw, hypotensive → RED
Case B: 30-year-old mild pleuritic pain after cough, normal vitals → GREEN

Documentation Notes:
Record in e-PR:

- Pain score and character
- Time and results of first ECG
- Vital signs at triage and after interventions
- Medications given (aspirin, nitrates)
