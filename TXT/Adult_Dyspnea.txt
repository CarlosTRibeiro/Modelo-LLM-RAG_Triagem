Scenario: Adult Dyspnea
Tags: respiratory, adult, dyspnea, wheeze, COPD, asthma, embolism, pneumothorax

Description:
Triage flow for adult patients presenting with sudden or worsening shortness of breath.  
Includes everyday phrasing so the assistant can match patient language directly.

Glossary Terms Used:
- Airway obstruction (also “I’m choking,” “I can’t breathe at all”)
- Inadequate breathing (also “My breaths are tiny,” “I’m gasping”)
- Stridor (also “I hear a squeak when I inhale”)
- Drooling (also “I can’t swallow my spit”)
- Shock (also “I feel cold and faint”)
- Acute dyspnea (also “I suddenly can’t catch my breath”)
- Chest pain (also “It feels like pressure in my chest”)
- Very low PEF (≤ 33 % predicted; “My peak flow is down to 30%”)
- Low PEF (≤ 50 % predicted; “I only blow at half my usual”)
- Wheeze (also “My chest is whistling”)
- Productive cough (also “I’m coughing up green phlegm”)
- Chest trauma (also “I fell on my chest yesterday”)
- Recent event (≤ 14 days; “I had surgery last week”)

Specific Discriminators:
Red:
  - Airway obstruction (“I can’t take a breath”)  
  - Inadequate breathing (“I’m barely breathing”)  
  - Stridor (“There’s a high-pitched squeak when I breathe in”)  
  - Drooling (“My mouth is full of spit and I can’t swallow”)  
  - Shock (“I feel cold, clammy, and like I’ll pass out”)

Orange:
  - Acute dyspnea (“It hit me out of nowhere—I can’t breathe”)  
  - Chest pain (“My chest feels crushed, like something heavy”)  
  - Very low PEF (≤ 33 % predicted; patient: “My peak flow reads 30”)  
  - Hemoptysis (“I’m coughing up blood”)  
  - Exhaustion (“I’m so tired I can’t keep breathing hard”)

Yellow:
  - Low PEF (≤ 50 % predicted; patient: “I only blow half as hard”)  
  - Pleuritic pain (“It stabs when I breathe or cough”)

Green:
  - Wheeze (“My chest is whistling when I breathe out”)  
  - Productive cough (“I’m coughing up a lot of phlegm”)  
  - Chest trauma (“I bruised my chest in a fall”)  
  - Recent event (≤ 14 days; “I had pneumonia two weeks ago”)

Measurement Notes (in patient language):
  - “How many breaths do you take per minute when you’re resting?”  
  - “Does your peak flow meter show less than half your usual?”  
  - “Is your oxygen reading below 90% even with extra oxygen?”

Examples of Patient Questions:
  - “I feel like I’m suffocating, what should I do?”  
  - “My chest is tight and I’m panting, is it serious?”  
  - “It just happened out of nowhere—I can’t catch my breath.”

Age & Comorbidity Adjustments:
  - Elderly: “It’s normal to breathe up to 24 times a minute.”  
  - Asthma/COPD: “Use your personal best for peak flow comparison.”

Immediate Interventions:
  - “Prepare high-flow oxygen if SpO₂ < 92%.”  
  - “Give nebulizer within 15 minutes if patient has wheezing.”  
  - “Secure IV access and monitor vitals continuously.”

Associated Signs to Check:
  - “Is your capillary refill over 2 seconds?”  
  - “Do you see blue lips or fingernails?”  
  - “Are you using your neck muscles to breathe?”

Brief Case Examples:
  - Case A: 65-year-old COPD, PEF 30%, SpO₂ 88% → ORANGE  
  - Case B: 40-year-old mild wheeze, PEF 60%, no pain → GREEN
