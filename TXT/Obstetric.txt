Scenario: Obstetric Emergency
Tags: obstetric, pregnancy, labor, bleeding, eclampsia, hemorrhage, cord prolapse, fetal presentation

Description:
Triage flow for pregnant patients presenting with obstetric complications. Uses patient-friendly language so the assistant can match what a pregnant person might say with clinical discriminators. Covers life-threatening emergencies to non-urgent presentations.

Glossary Terms Used:

- Airway obstruction (also “I can’t breathe,” “choking feeling”)
- Inadequate breathing (also “gasping,” “shortness of breath”)
- Shock (also “feeling faint,” “cold, clammy skin”)
- Heavy vaginal bleeding (also “soaking through pads fast,” “clots”)
- Vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks (also “bleeding in late pregnancy”)
- Fetal presentation (also “I can feel baby’s head at my cervix”)
- Cord prolapse (also “I see the umbilical cord,” “cord hanging out”)
- Active labor (also “I’m having contractions every few minutes”)
- Sudden alteration of consciousness (also “I blacked out,” “I lost awareness”)
- History of seizure (also “I had a fit six hours ago”)

Specific Discriminators:
Red:

- Airway obstruction (“I can’t breathe at all”)
- Inadequate breathing (“I’m gasping for air”)
- Shock (“I feel cold, clammy, and dizzy”)
- Heavy vaginal bleeding (“My pad is soaked in 15 minutes”)
- Fetal presentation (“I can see baby’s crown at my vagina”)
- Cord prolapse (“I see the cord coming out”)
- Seizuring (“I’m having tonic-clonic movements”)

Orange:

- Active labor (≥ 3 painful contractions in 10 minutes; “I’m contracting every two minutes”)
- Sudden alteration of consciousness (“I blacked out a moment ago”)
- History of seizure within last 6 hours (“I had a seizure four hours ago”)
- Vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks (“I’m bleeding at 32 weeks pregnant”)
- Intense pain (≥ 8/10; “My belly pain is excruciating”)

Yellow:

- Moderate pain (4–7/10; “It’s a 5 out of 10”)
- Mild vaginal bleeding (spotting; “Just pink spots on my pad”)
- History of trauma within 24 h (“I fell two hours ago”)
- History discordant (“My story doesn’t match what you see”)
- Pain radiating to shoulder (“My shoulder hurts when I move”)

Green:

- Fever (maternal temperature ≥ 37.5 °C; “I feel hot, like I have a temperature”)
- Mild recent pain (1–3/10, onset < 24 h; “It’s a 2 out of 10 that started today”)

Measurement Notes:

- “How many contractions did you have in the last ten minutes?”
- “How many pads did you soak per hour?” (soaked every 15 min = heavy)
- “Is your blood pressure above or below 140/90 mmHg?”

Examples of Patient Questions:

- “How many painful contractions have you had in the last ten minutes?”
- “Are you bleeding, and how many pads do you use per hour?”
- “Where exactly is your pain, and how bad is it?”

Age & Comorbidity Adjustments:

- Gestational diabetes or hypertension: monitor BP and glucose closely
- Grand multiparity: may under-report labor pain intensity

Immediate Interventions:

- Cord prolapse: elevate presenting part and call obstetrician immediately
- Heavy bleeding: establish two large-bore IV lines; begin fluids and blood products
- Seizuring in pregnancy: give magnesium sulfate if eclampsia suspected

Associated Sign Checklist:

- Uterine tone and contraction strength
- Fetal heart rate monitoring
- Capillary refill > 2 s (sign of maternal shock)
- Neurological signs (hyperreflexia, clonus)

Quick Protocol Links:

- “Administer MgSO₄ 4 g IV over 5–10 min per eclampsia protocol.”
- “If cord prolapse, prepare for emergency cesarean.”

Brief Case Examples:
Case A: 32 weeks pregnant, cord visible at introitus → RED
Case B: 38 weeks, mild spotting, no contractions → GREEN

Documentation Notes:

- Record gestational age, parity, and antenatal history
- Document contraction frequency and strength
- Note estimated blood loss and pad count
- Record vital signs and any interventions performed
