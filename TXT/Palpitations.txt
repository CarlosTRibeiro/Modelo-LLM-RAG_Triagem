Scenario: Palpitations
Tags: cardiac, palpitations, arrhythmia, tachycardia, bradycardia, syncope, overdose, poisoning

Description:
Triage flow for patients who notice their heart beating abnormally. Includes common patient phrases so the assistant can match how people describe palpitations with clinical discriminators. Covers life-threatening arrhythmias to benign, resolved episodes.

Glossary Terms Used:

- Airway obstruction (also “I can’t breathe,” “choking feeling”)
- Inadequate breathing (also “gasping,” “can’t catch my breath”)
- Shock (also “cold, clammy skin,” “I feel faint”)
- Chest pain (also “pressure,” “tightness,” “burning”)
- Acute dyspnea (also “sudden breathlessness,” “I’m gasping”)
- Abnormal pulse (HR < 60 or > 100 or irregular; “my heart is racing,” “it’s skipping beats”)
- Adult hot (fever ≥ 37.5 °C; “I feel hot and sweaty”)
- Adult very hot (fever ≥ 38.5 °C; “I’m burning up”)
- History of overdose or poisoning (also “I took too many pills,” “I was poisoned”)
- Sudden alteration of consciousness (also “I blacked out,” “I felt gone for a moment”)
- Seizuring (active tonic-clonic movements; “I’m having a fit”)
- Recent event (≤ 14 days; “I had surgery last week”)

Specific Discriminators:
Red:

- Airway obstruction (“I can’t breathe at all”)
- Inadequate breathing (“I’m barely breathing”)
- Shock (“My skin is cold and clammy, I feel faint”)
- Sudden alteration of consciousness (“I just blacked out”)

Orange:

- Abnormal pulse (“My heart is racing at 150 bpm,” “It skips beats”)
- Chest pain (“I feel tight pressure in my chest”)
- Acute dyspnea (“All of a sudden I can’t catch my breath”)
- History of overdose or poisoning (“I swallowed a bottle of pills”)
- Adult very hot (“My temperature is 39 °C and I’m shaking”)
- Seizuring (“I’m having convulsions right now”)

Yellow:

- Ongoing palpitations at assessment (“I can still feel my heart pounding”)
- History of unconsciousness (syncope; “I fainted last night”)
- History of cardiac disease (“I have atrial fibrillation,” “I’ve had a pacemaker”)
- Adult hot (“I have a mild fever of 37.8 °C”)

Green:

- Recent event (≤ 14 days; “I had a bad panic attack two days ago”)
- No current palpitations and stable vitals (“My heart feels normal now”)

Measurement Notes:

- “Count your pulse for 60 seconds if irregular, or 15 seconds×4 if regular.”
- “Is your temperature above 38.5 °C or above 37.5 °C?”
- “Check your respiratory rate and oxygen saturation to rule out breathing issues.”

Examples of Patient Questions:

- “Is my heart still racing right now?”
- “Have you ever felt lightheaded when it raced?”
- “Do you have any history of heart problems?”

Age & Comorbidity Adjustments:

- Elderly may not feel palpitations but show hypotension—watch BP closely.
- Patients on beta-blockers may not mount a high heart rate.

Immediate Interventions:

- Attach ECG monitor and obtain 12-lead ECG promptly.
- If unstable (hypotension, chest pain), prepare for synchronized cardioversion.
- In suspected overdose, consider activated charcoal and call toxicology.

Associated Sign Checklist:

- Blood pressure < 90/60 mmHg
- Altered mental status or syncope
- Diaphoresis and pallor
- Agitation or confusion (possible toxidrome)

Quick Protocol Links:

- “Follow ACLS tachyarrhythmia algorithm if unstable.”
- “Refer to toxicology protocol for overdose management.”

Brief Case Examples:
Case A: 25-year-old with new-onset atrial fibrillation, BP 80/50 mmHg → RED
Case B: 45-year-old with occasional skipped beats, normal vitals → GREEN

Documentation Notes:

- Record heart rate and rhythm (regular vs irregular)
- Time and result of first ECG
- Any antiarrhythmic or sedative medications given
- Vital signs at triage and after interventions
