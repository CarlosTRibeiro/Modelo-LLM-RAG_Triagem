Scenario: Palpitations
Tags: cardiac, palpitations, arrhythmia, tachycardia, bradycardia, syncope, overdose, poisoning

Description:
Triage flow for patients who notice their heart beating abnormally. Includes common patient phrases so the assistant can match how people describe palpitations with clinical discriminators. Covers life-threatening arrhythmias to benign, resolved episodes.

Glossary Terms Used:

- Airway obstruction
- Inadequate breathing
- Shock
- Chest pain
- Acute dyspnea
- Abnormal pulse
- Adult hot
- Adult very hot
- History of overdose or poisoning
- Sudden alteration of consciousness
- Seizuring
- Recent event

Specific Discriminators:
Red:

- Airway obstruction
- Inadequate breathing
- Shock 
- Sudden alteration of consciousness

Orange:

- Abnormal pulse
- Chest pain
- Acute dyspnea
- History of overdose or poisoning
- Adult very hot
- Seizuring

Yellow:

- Ongoing palpitations at assessment
- History of unconsciousness
- History of cardiac disease
- Adult hot

Green:

- Recent event
- No current palpitations and stable vitals

Age & Comorbidity Adjustments:

- Elderly may not feel palpitations but show hypotension—watch BP closely.
- Patients on beta-blockers may not mount a high heart rate.

Immediate Interventions:

- Attach ECG monitor and obtain 12-lead ECG promptly.
- If unstable (hypotension, chest pain), prepare for synchronized cardioversion.
- In suspected overdose, consider activated charcoal and call toxicology.

Associated Sign Checklist:

- Blood pressure < 90/60 mmHg
- Altered mental status or syncope
- Diaphoresis and pallor
- Agitation or confusion (possible toxidrome)

Quick Protocol Links:

- “Follow ACLS tachyarrhythmia algorithm if unstable.”
- “Refer to toxicology protocol for overdose management.”

Documentation Notes:

- Record heart rate and rhythm (regular vs irregular)
- Time and result of first ECG
- Any antiarrhythmic or sedative medications given
- Vital signs at triage and after interventions
